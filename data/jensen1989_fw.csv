# Jensen, Sumer & Fredsoe (1989), Fig. 11: wave friction factor f_w
# Digitized from the original paper.
# Re_a = U_0^2 / (omega * nu) is Jensen's convention.
# Re_delta = U_0 * delta / nu (delta = sqrt(2*nu/omega)) is our convention.
# Relation: Re_a = Re_delta^2 / 2, i.e. Re_delta = sqrt(2 * Re_a).
